# DINOv2 vs ResNet Classification

This repository contains a comparison between DINOv2 and ResNet classification models. The analysis is performed using two Jupyter notebooks:

1. `DinoV2_VS_ResnetClassification.ipynb`
2. `PCA_visualization.ipynb`

## Notebooks

### 1. DinoV2_VS_ResnetClassification.ipynb

This notebook provides a detailed comparison between the DINOv2 and ResNet models. It includes:

- Data preprocessing steps
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics and comparison
- Visualizations of the results

### 2. PCA_visualization.ipynb

This notebook focuses on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualizing the feature space of the models. It includes:

- PCA implementation
- Visualization of the principal components
- Analysis of the feature space

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DINOv2.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd DINOv2
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open the notebooks using Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
